        <h2>Why Books Are So Important?</h2>
        <p>
            They say that <q>“When you open a book, you open a new world”.</q>
            I believe that everyone would agree with this statement as books have become inevitable to mankind. 
            For the majority of people, books are part of their everyday life. 
            A book is like a best friend who will never walk away from you.
